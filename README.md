As the need for machine learning and AI continues to grow, new technologies will always come to market that will impact our day-to-day operations, and other such technologies as Virtual Assistant Bots or just Chatbots. Chatbots has changed from Menu / Button, to keywords that are derived and are now based on context. In this paper we will discuss not only the performance of our model but also the applications and relevant work done on this domain, and there will be discussions about the challenges and future scope of this technology. In this work, neural networks used to train various data and packages help us to deliver better results. In this chatbot we will combine the concepts of Natural Language Analysis and In-Depth Learning to get the best results.
